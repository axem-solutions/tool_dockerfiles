# Open Tool Dockerfiles

Welcome to **OTD** - an open and collaborative repo for storing and sharing Dockerfiles, specifically tailored for **embedded software development tools**. Our mission is to create a community-driven repository where developers can freely contribute, access, and utilize containerized build systems, debuggers, toolchains and more.

## ðŸ“¦ What is OTD?

**OTD** is an open-source project designed to host Dockerfiles for a wide range of development tools 
used in **embedded software** engineering. If you're looking for a specific tool but can't find it 
here, feel free to create a Dockerfile and add it to this repo.

At axem we create container images based on the Dockerfiles in this repository, and push them to our 
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/axemsolutions) account. This allows developers to easily pull 
and run the images on their local machines.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Open and Free**: All Dockerfiles are free to use and contribute to. We believe in the power of open collaboration.
- **Community Driven**: Built by the community, for the community. Anyone can contribute new Dockerfiles or improve existing ones.
- **Organized and Searchable**: Dockerfiles are categorized and tagged for easy navigation and discovery.

## ðŸš€ Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. See our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/axem-solutions/tool_dockerfiles/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
for more information on how to get started.

## ðŸ“š Documentation

## ðŸ’¬ Community and Support

Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3aHuJBNvrJ) to discuss the project, ask questions, and share your experiences. 

## Containerized Tools maintained by others

If a tool provider publishes a container image, we will not duplicate it here. Instead, we will link 
to the official image.
