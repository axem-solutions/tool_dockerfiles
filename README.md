# Open Tool Dockerfiles

Welcome to **OTD** - an open and collaborative repo for storing and sharing Dockerfiles, specifically tailored for **embedded software development tools**. Our mission is to create a community-driven repository where developers can freely contribute, access, and utilize containerized build systems, debuggers, toolchains and more.

## 📦 What is OTD?

**OTD** is an open-source project designed to host Dockerfiles for a wide range of development tools used in **embedded software** engineering. If you're looking for a specific tool but can't find it here, feel free to create a Dockerfile and add it to this repo.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Open and Free**: All Dockerfiles are free to use and contribute to. We believe in the power of open collaboration.
- **Community Driven**: Built by the community, for the community. Anyone can contribute new Dockerfiles or improve existing ones.
- **Organized and Searchable**: Dockerfiles are categorized and tagged for easy navigation and discovery.
